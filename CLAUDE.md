# Airtalk — Project Context

You are building Airtalk, a multi-tenant SaaS where small businesses create AI voice
agents that answer/place phone calls. We are a THIN CONTROL PLANE over ElevenLabs
Agents (which runs the actual STT/LLM/TTS conversation and telephony via its native
Twilio integration). Our code NEVER touches audio.

## STACK (do not deviate without asking)

- Turborepo monorepo: apps/web (Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui),
  packages/engine (provider adapter), packages/db (Supabase client + types + SQL migrations)
- Supabase: Postgres + Auth + Storage. All tenant tables have org_id with RLS.
- Stripe Billing, Twilio (numbers only), ElevenLabs Agents API, Sentry, Inngest (Phase 6+).
- Deploy: Vercel. Env vars via .env.local, validated with zod in a single env.ts.

## HARD RULES

1. Provider isolation: ElevenLabs types/HTTP calls exist ONLY inside packages/engine.
   Core tables store provider + provider_*_id strings. Everything else consumes the
   VoiceEngine interface.
2. Every webhook handler: verify signature → insert into webhook_events with UNIQUE
   event_id (skip on conflict = idempotent) → store raw payload jsonb → then process.
3. Money loops (outbound calls, campaigns) always have a cap and a kill switch.
4. Agent configs are versioned: every save writes a new row in agent_config_versions.
5. Usage/billing numbers come from nightly reconciliation against the provider API,
   never from webhooks alone.
6. When an external API shape is unknown, consult current docs (ElevenLabs:
   https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference, Twilio, Stripe) rather than inventing it.
7. Write a minimal test (vitest) for money math and webhook idempotency. Skip UI tests.

## THE VoiceEngine INTERFACE (packages/engine/src/types.ts)

Implement providers against this, never leak past it:

```
createAgent(cfg: AgentConfig) → { providerAgentId }
updateAgent(providerAgentId, cfg: Partial<AgentConfig>) → void
deleteAgent(providerAgentId) → void
importNumber(twilioSid, e164) → { providerNumberId }
attachNumber(providerNumberId, providerAgentId) → void
startOutboundCall(providerAgentId, toE164, vars?) → { providerCallId }
startBatch(providerAgentId, contacts[]) → { batchId }
addKnowledge(providerAgentId, source: {url?, file?}) → { knowledgeId }
verifyWebhook(req) → boolean
normalizeCallEvent(payload) → CallEvent { providerCallId, direction, fromE164, toE164,
  startedAt, durationSecs, transcript, recordingUrl, status, costCents? }
```

(Updated after each phase: chosen endpoints, payload quirks, decisions made.)
